## Description: 
Welcome to my Final Project for the UWA Full Stack Bootcamp course!
This is a modernisation of the website for the community I belong to, Couples for Christ Western Australia, using a full-stack MERN application.
The site can be previewed here: https://couples-for-christ-wa.herokuapp.com/ .
An admin account has been created that has access to all features. Please email me to get the login credentials.
